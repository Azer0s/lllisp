;; For Loops Example
;; This file demonstrates the for loop syntax in LLLisp

;; Range-based for loop with list
(out "Iterating over a list:\n")
(for (range item (list "Hello" "World" "LLLisp"))
    (do
        (out item)
        (out "\n")
    )
)

;; Range-based for loop with numeric range
(out "\nCounting from 0 to 9:\n")
(for (range i (to 10))
    (do
        (out i)
        (out " ")
    )
)
(out "\n")

;; Condition-based for loop (like while loop)
(out "\nCondition-based loop:\n")
(def counter 0)
(for (< counter 5)
    (do
        (out "Counter: ")
        (out counter)
        (out "\n")
        (def counter (+ counter 1))
    )
)

;; Loop with early termination condition
(out "\nLoop with termination condition:\n")
(def i 0)
(for (< i 10)
    (do
        (out "Iteration ")
        (out i)
        (out "\n")
        (def i (+ i 1))
        
        ;; Simulate early termination with a condition
        (if (>= i 3)
            (def i 10)  ;; Force the loop condition to fail
        )
    )
)

;; Nested for loops
(out "\nNested for loops:\n")
(for (range i (to 3))
    (for (range j (to 3))
        (do
            (out "(")
            (out i)
            (out ",")
            (out j)
            (out ") ")
        )
    )
    (out "\n")
)

;; For loop with complex expressions
(out "\nSquares of numbers:\n")
(for (range n (to 5))
    (do
        (def square (* n n))
        (out n)
        (out "Â² = ")
        (out square)
        (out "\n")
    )
)
